Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of systematically applying engineering principles methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality sofware systems.It enables the creation of softwares that power various aspects of modern life eg communications

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
3. Advent of structured programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements-gathering user and system needs
2. design-this is creating high level and detailed designs of software architech
3. implementation- this is writing code and bulding software according to the designs
4. Testing- ensuring the software meets quality standards and functionality
5. deployment- this is releasing the software to the users
6. maintenance-providing support and updates to the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In a waterfall methodology, the approach is sequential i.e requirements,design, implementation, downwards like a waterfall while in an agile methodology, the approach is incremental focusing on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.  Software Developer- writing codes and implementing software solutions
2.   Quality Assurance Engineer- run tests on softwares to ascertain quality 
3.   Project Manager- oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The IDEs provides tools for writing, debbuging and testing code eg visual studio whereas VCS profides software tools for tracking changes in source code and provide cordination among team members eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. change in reqirements during development leading to delays
2. Tough deadlines can lead to rush hence compromised quality
3. Technical debt from shotcuts can affect future developments

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing- this is testing of individual components
2. intergration testing- involves testing intergration between subsystems
3. system testing - involves testing entire system
4. acceptance- ensuring the software meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of designing questions to get the best response from AI models.It helps to avoid getting a confused answer since AI understand the specifc question

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example; "tell me something about houses?"
An improved prompt; "tell me about mansionettes houses and their latest internal fittings?"
